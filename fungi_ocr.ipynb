    "        1. Each image contains two sections of text chunks. One is the bar code, and the other is the sample information.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2. The languages are only in English or German.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3. The bar code chunk starts with 'Herbarium der ETH Zurich (ZT)' followed by a barcode with text such as 'ZT Myc 0105537'. The task here is to extract the barcode text.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        4. The sample information chunk starts with a division separator, such as 'Dr. F. Petrak, Mycotheca generalis.'\n",

    "        \n",
    "        6. Matrix and Locality: A line that holds the information (e.g., Ungarn; Comit. Gyor: Bonyretalap). If a sample is missing a Matrix and Locality line, leave it blank. Extract as it is, no more added information\n",
    "        \n",
    "        7. Date: A line that has a Roman numeral month plus year (e.g., V.1920, X.1924, XII.1924), from which you split out: * Month → Roman numeral (e.g., V, X, XII) * Year → numeric year (e.g., 1920, 1924). Note, sometimes the month can be a normal English month with abbreviations\n",
